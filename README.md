## What is this?

PolyArena is a terminal app that pits **10 AI agents** against each other in structured debates about [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) prediction markets. You pick a market — paste a URL, browse trending, or load a saved one — and watch 10 differently-opinionated AIs argue YES or NO across 3 rounds, reading each other's arguments before each vote.

After the debate you get:
- 📊 **Live graphs** — consensus trend, YES/NO split, per-agent breakdown, donut chart
- 💾 **Auto-save** — markets and full debate logs saved as JSON
- 💬 **Post-debate chat** — interrogate any of the 10 AIs about why they voted the way they did

All powered by **Groq's free API** running **Llama 3.3 70B**. No credit card. No paid subscription.

## Demo

```
  🔴  DEBATE OPENED
  Will Bitcoin exceed $120k in 2026?
  Market  YES 44.0%  ·  NO 56.0%  ·  Vol $3,800,000

  ── ROUND 1/3  [llama-3.3-70b-versatile] ──

  AXIOM-1    [YES]  Historical BTC cycles suggest a new ATH is overdue; the 4-year
                    halving pattern strongly supports a push past $120k.
  VERA-2     [ NO]  The market has already priced in the halving — smart money
                    exited months ago. This rally is retail FOMO, not fundamentals.
  NEXUS-3    [YES]  Updating on AXIOM's cycle data: prior probability shifts to ~60%.
                    Insufficient evidence to override the base rate here.
  KIRA-4     [ NO]  Institutional custody narratives are manufactured hype. Actual
                    on-chain accumulation data doesn't support the bull case.
  ...

  ── ROUND 2/3 ──
  ...

  ⚡  FINAL VERDICT: NO  (13 YES · 17 NO · 57% confidence)

## How it works

### The debate engine

Each debate runs **3 rounds × 10 agents = 30 AI calls** total.

Before each vote, an agent receives:
- The market question and live Polymarket YES/NO price
- The current running vote tally
- The last 8 messages from the debate transcript

This means agents genuinely **read and respond to each other** — VERA-2 will push back on AXIOM-1's argument, LYRA-8 will stress-test whatever position is winning.

Each agent responds with structured JSON:
```json
{"vote": "YES", "reason": "1-2 sentence reasoning citing previous arguments"}
```

### The AI agents

All 10 agents run on **Llama 3.3 70B via Groq** but with different system prompts shaping their reasoning style:

| Agent | Personality |
|---|---|
| **AXIOM-1** | Rational analyst — base rates, historical data, hard statistics |
| **VERA-2** | Contrarian — assumes crowds are systematically wrong |
| **NEXUS-3** | Bayesian — thinks in likelihood ratios, updates incrementally |
| **KIRA-4** | Skeptic — doubts narratives, looks for hidden incentives |
| **ORION-5** | Momentum trader — follows trends and smart money |
| **ECHO-6** | Balanced synthesizer — weighs both sides carefully |
| **DANTE-7** | Fundamentalist — ignores noise, focuses on structural forces |
| **LYRA-8** | Devil's advocate — argues the unpopular side |
| **SIGMA-9** | Statistician — only trusts quantifiable evidence |
| **ZETA-10** | Philosopher — questions the framing of the question itself |

### The consensus signal

After each vote, PolyArena computes a **blended consensus price**:

```
consensus = market_price × 0.65 + (ai_yes_votes / total_votes) × 0.35
```

This shows you whether the AI collective is more bullish or bearish than the live Polymarket price — tracked in real time on the graph.

### Polymarket integration

PolyArena uses Polymarket's public **Gamma API** (no auth required):

```
https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets?slug={slug}
https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets?closed=false&limit=20&order=volume
```

It auto-extracts the slug from any Polymarket URL format:
- `https://polymarket.com/event/will-bitcoin-hit-100k`
- `https://polymarket.com/market/will-bitcoin-hit-100k`
- `will-bitcoin-hit-100k` (bare slug also works)

## Menu walkthrough

```
MAIN MENU
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  [1]  🔗  Paste Polymarket URL  →  auto-fetch ID, data & save
  [2]  🔥  Browse live trending markets
  [3]  📁  My saved markets  →  start a debate
  [4]  📊  Past debate results  →  view graphs
  [5]  🤖  Agent roster
  [q]  Exit
```

**Option 1 — URL paste:** Paste any Polymarket URL. The app extracts the slug, hits the API, shows you the market data (question, ID, slug, YES/NO prices, volume), and lets you save it and/or debate it immediately.

**Option 2 — Trending:** Fetches the top 8 markets by volume live from Polymarket. Pick one to save or debate.

**Option 3 — Saved markets:** Browse your saved markets, pick one to debate, or delete ones you no longer need.

**Option 4 — Past debates:** View a list of all past debate results with their verdicts and timestamps. Pick one to regenerate its graph.

**Option 5 — Roster:** See all 10 agents and their personalities.

## Post-debate chat

After every debate you can open a chat session with the AIs:

```
  💬  POST-DEBATE CHAT
  Commands:
    1-10 / name  → private multi-turn chat with that agent
    all          → broadcast your question to all 10 agents at once
    roster       → show agents and their round-by-round votes
    q            → back to menu
```

**Private chat** — full multi-turn conversation with one agent. They remember the entire debate and their own votes. You can challenge their reasoning and they'll push back (or change their mind if you make a good argument).

**Panel mode** (`all`) — ask one question and get a response from all 10 agents in sequence. Great for seeing how differently they interpret the same follow-up question.

---

## Graphs

After every debate, a PNG is saved to `polyarena_graphs/` and auto-opened. The 4-panel chart includes:

1. **AI Consensus YES% over Time** — area chart tracking how the AI signal moved across all 30 votes, with a dashed line showing the live market price
2. **Cumulative YES vs NO Vote Share** — dual area chart showing the running vote split as the debate progressed
3. **Per-Agent Vote Breakdown** — stacked bar chart showing how many YES/NO votes each agent cast across all 3 rounds
4. **Final Split** — donut chart with the final YES/NO percentages and the winning verdict in the center

---

## Groq model fallback

If you hit a rate limit, PolyArena automatically tries the next model:

```
llama-3.3-70b-versatile   ← primary (best)
llama-3.1-70b-versatile   ← fallback 1
mixtral-8x7b-32768        ← fallback 2
llama3-70b-8192           ← fallback 3
```

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome. Some ideas if you want to contribute:

- **More agents** — add agents with different personas (macro trader, political analyst, sports bettor)
- **More markets** — support Kalshi, Manifold, or other prediction market APIs
- **Web UI** — a Flask/FastAPI version with a proper frontend
- **Persistent agent memory** — agents remember past debates on the same market
- **Multi-market correlation** — debate whether two related markets are mispriced relative to each other
- **Export** — export debate transcripts to PDF or markdown
- **Discord bot** — run debates triggered by Discord commands

To contribute:
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. Commit your changes
4. Open a pull request
